# CoffeePi
This repository is for the Raspberry Pi coffee machine in the Software Engineering lab at UNB-F

The raspberry Pi will be connected to the coffee machine and to a monitor beside the coffee machine. 
The monitor should display the index.html file in this repo. 

Future Updates:
 
 Software:
  - Automatic shut off after X hours.
  - Show information based on the state of the coffee machine
    - Add Water
    - Add Grounds
    - Ready to Brew
    - Coffee brewed (Display brew time)
  - Some kind of slideshow, 
    - images/jokes/greetings/etc. 
    - This could take up the whole screen, or just half the screen. 
  - Setup a way for the pi to stay updated with this repo. (Web Hook?)
  
 Hardware:
  - Check voltage of button on coffee machine to find out if we need to use a Relay.
  - 3D print a button box with 3 buttons and connect these buttons to the Pi's GPIO pins.  
    - Brew Coffee 
    - Added Water
    - Added Grounds
